ABOUT:
------

This code uses a finite-difference method to compute the modes of
electromagnetic waveguides at a specified wavelength.

Features:

* The waveguide is assumed to have a piecewise constant
  refractive-index profile (a "step-index" profile), i.e., the
  waveguide cross section can consist of several adjacent regions of
  constant refractive index. The interfaces between these regions do
  not need to coincide with the discretization grid: they may be
  straight (under any arbitrary angle) or curved (as in optical
  fibers).

* The entire waveguide may be curved along the propagation direction,
  thus enabling the computation of bending or curvature losses. The
  simulation is based on cylindrical coordinates adapted to the
  waveguide curvature and does not rely on the widespread approximate
  equivalent-straight-waveguide model.

* The computation is fully vectorial. It does not make any a-priori
  assumptions about the magnitude of the six electromagnetic field
  components. (However, approximate scalar or semi-vectorial
  calculation modes may optionally be enabled by the user.)

* The four edges of the rectangular computational domain are enclosed
  by perfectly electrically or magnetically conducting walls. These
  walls may be padded with Perfectly Matched Layers in order to absorb
  outgoing radiation and thus simulate leakage and curvature losses.

The dielectrics are assumed to be isotropic and non-magnetic. Lossy
materials are supported in the form of materials with complex
refractive indices.

The software is written in C++ and uses the ARPACK and SuperLU
libraries to solve the discretized eigenproblem. It should compile
under any Unix-type operating system. Scripts for post-processing and
visualization of the results in Matlab are provided.

METHOD:
-------

The discretization method used here is based on a method proposed in

  Y.-C. Chiang, Y.-P. Chiou, and H.-C. Chang, "Improved Full-Vectorial
  Finite-Difference Mode Solver for Optical Waveguides With Step-Index
  Profiles," J. Lightwave Technol., vol. 20, no. 8, pp. 1609â€“1618,
  Aug. 2002.

wgms3d is based on a generalization of the concepts of Chiang et
al. to curved waveguides and employs a simplified formulation. The
details are described in

  M. Krause, "Finite-Difference Mode Solver for Curved Waveguides with
  Angled and Curved Dielectric Interfaces", J. Lightwave Technol.,
  vol. 29, no. 5, pp. 691-699 (2011).

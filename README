	This fork of wgms3d has been modified to run on my system using PETSC
	and SLEPC. It might be necessary to run "touch configure.ac aclocal.m4 
	configure Makefile.am Makefile.in".

	I'm configuring PETSC (3.9) with the following flags:
	./configure --with-mpi --download-scalapack --download-metis 
	--download-parmetis --download-mumps --download-superlu_dist 
	--with-clanguage=c++ --with-debugging=0 COPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native' 
	FOPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native' CXXOPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native' 
	--with-scalar-type=complex --download-mpich --download-fblaslapack=1 
	--with-cmake

	Running wgms3d might require adding the following to LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH='.../slepc/arch-linux2-cxx-opt/lib':$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

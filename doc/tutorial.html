      <h3>1. Definition of waveguide geometry</h3>

      <p>Use a text editor to create a file called <tt>fiber.mgp</tt>:</p>

      <div class="codebox">
	# 'Background index' = refractive index at z -> +infinity<br>
	n 1.5<br>
	# Circular interface:<br>
	#   outside index = 1.5, inside index = 3.5,<br>
	#   center &rho; = 0, center z = 0, radius = .16 microns<br>
	c 1.5 3.5 0 0 .16<br>
	# Define 'core area', explained below<br>
	C -.2 -.2 .2 .2<br>
	x
      </div>

      <p>This is a simple waveguide-geometry file for wgms3d representing a fiber of .16 microns radius and a refractive
	index of 3.5 embedded in a surrounding medium of refractive index 1.5. The lines starting with '<tt>#</tt>' are
	simply comments, you may leave them out. The '<tt>x</tt>' marks the end of the input file.</p>

      <p>The two-dimensional waveguide cross section is spanned by the lateral ("horizontal") &rho; axis and by the
	vertical z axis (<a href="coords.png">figure</a>).</p>

      <p>The line beginning with '<tt>C</tt>' defines an area and is optional for our first calculations. It is only
	required later for leakage / curvature calculations where the mode fields may have both real and imaginary
	parts. In those cases wgms3d multiplies the whole mode field with a constant phase factor such that the mode
	field in the area defined by '<tt>C</tt>' is approximately real (this has no physical significance, but is
	useful vor visualization purposes). The syntax is '<tt>C &rho;1 z1 &rho;2 z2</tt>', meaning an area spanned by
	the lower left point (&rho;,z)=(<tt>&rho;1,z1</tt>) and the upper right point (<tt>&rho;2,z2</tt>).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrapper">

      <h3>2. Plot the waveguide geometry in Matlab</h3>

      <p>For a first check whether you've entered the geometry correctly, start up Matlab, change the current directory
	to that where <tt>fiber.mgp</tt> resides, and make sure the <tt>matlab</tt> subdirectory from the wgms3d
	distribution is in Matlab's search path (e.g., using the menu "File" - "Set Path..." or the <tt>addpath</tt>
	command). Then type</p>

      <div class="codebox">
	>> wgms3d_plot_mgp('fiber.mgp')
      </div>

      <div class="figure"><img src="plotmgp.png" width=281 height=264 alt="Plot of fiber geometry file."></div>
      <p>at the Matlab prompt. This should open a figure and show the boundaries of the dielectric interfaces you have
	defined.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrapper">

      <h3>3. Run wgms3d to calculate the modes</h3>

      <p>Open a terminal, change the current directory to that where <tt>fiber.mgp</tt> resides, make sure wgms3d is in
	your search path, and run</p>

      <div class="codebox">
	$ wgms3d -g fiber.mgp -l 1.55 -U -0.8:120:+0.8 -V -0.8:120:+0.8 -n 4
      </div>

      <p>These command-line arguments have the following meaning:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><tt>-g fiber.mgp</tt> specifies the waveguide-geometry file</li>
	<li><tt>-l 1.55</tt> specifies the wavelength (1.55 microns)</li>
	<li><tt>-U -0.8:120:+0.8</tt> specifies the horizontal (&rho;-axis) discretization grid, here: 120 uniformly
	  spaced points between -0.8 and +0.8 microns. (you can specify arbitrary non-uniform grids, too, see the
	  example in the <tt>tests/silicon_strip_waveguide/</tt> subdirectory in the wgms3d distribution)</li>
	<li><tt>-V -0.8:120:+0.8</tt>: same for the vertical (z-axis) grid.</li>
	<li><tt>-n 4</tt> tells wgms3d to calculate the 4 modes of the structure with the largest effective index (or
	  propagation constant).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>After a few seconds you should get an output like this:

      <p>You can see the four modes listed with their effective indices. The first two modes (0 and 1) have
	approximately the same index of 1.98 -- those modes correspond to the two polarizations of the fundamental mode
	of the circular fiber (which, in theory, should have <em>identical</em> effective indices; but remember this is
	an approximate numerical solution)</p>

      <p>Furthermore, wgms3d has generated several output files, namely <tt>x.txt</tt>, <tt>y.txt</tt>, and (most
	importantly) <tt>hr-XX.bin</tt> and <tt>hz-XX.bin</tt> which contain the &rho; and z components of the magnetic
	field of the waveguides modes (XX = 00, 01, 02, 03).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrapper">

      <h3>4. Visualize the result</h3>

      <p>To have a look at the modes, go back to your Matlab session and type</p>

      <div class="codebox">
	>> wgms3d_plot_ht(0, 'Geometry', 'fiber.mgp')
      </div>

      <div class="figure"><img src="plotht01.png" width=274 height=260 alt="Plot of fiber fundamental mode."></div>
      <p>This should open a figure window and plot contours representing the magnitude of the transverse magnetic mode
	field (in a linear scale), as well as arrows representing its vector direction; also the waveguide geometry is
	included for clarity, and the boundaries of the computational domain are indicated by thick red lines.</p>

      <p>The '<tt>ht</tt>' in the last command stands for 'transverse magnetic field'; there are similar commands for
	the transverse electric field (<tt>et</tt>), and for the longitudinal fields (<tt>hl</tt> and <tt>el</tt>),
	however for these to work you have to instruct wgms3d to calculate and export those fields, too (command-line
	options <tt>-E</tt>, <tt>-F</tt>, <tt>-G</tt>, and <tt>-H</tt>, respectively - just have a look at the help
	output: <tt>wgms3d -h</tt>).</p>

      <p class="clearfloats">
	The <tt>wgms3d_plot_XX</tt> commands have a lot more options, which you can find by looking inside those
	scripts. For example,</p>

      <div class="codebox">
	>> wgms3d_plot_ht(2, 'Geometry', 'fiber.mgp', 'LogContours', 1, 'QuiverGrid', 20, 'QuiverNormed', 'QuiverScale', 0.7)
      </div>

      <div class="figure"><img src="plotht02.png" width=274 height=260 alt="Plot of higher-order waveguide mode."></div>
      <p>gives you logarithmically spaced contours (here, in steps of 1 dB), makes the script re-interpolate the field
	data such that you get 20 x 20 arrows (give an argument of 0 to <tt>QuiverGrid</tt> to disable
	re-interpolation), and finally makes the arrows all have the same length instead of being proportional to the
	magnitude of the local field.</p>

      <p>This example shows mode #2: since its effective index of 1.451 is lower than the cladding index of 1.5, it
	shouldn't be interpreted as a mode guided by the fiber. In fact, it is a mode guided by a metallic waveguide
	with perfectly conducting walls (located at the borders of the computational domain) with a non-homogeneous
	dielectric filling.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="wrapper">

      <h3 class="clearfloats">5. Calculating leaky modes with Perfectly
	Matched Layers (PMLs)</h3>

      <p>Let's create a waveguide structure <tt>fiberleak.mgp</tt> that supports leaky modes (even when the waveguide
	itself is straight and not curved). To this end we take the fiber from above and add a little slab-like
	structure with a large refractive index at the right-hand side - admittedly it's a bit absurd, but it shows you
	how to create B&eacute;zier-type as well as straight dielectric interfaces:</p>

      <div class="codebox">
	<pre class="codebox">
n 1.5
c 1.5 3.5 0e-6 0e-6 .160e-6
b 1.5 3.5 .4e-6 -.1e-6 .4e-6 .2e-6 .6e-6 .2e-6
l 3.5 1.5 .4e-6 -.1e-6 .4e-6 -.2e-6
l 3.5 1.5 .4e-6 -.2e-6 100e-6 -.2e-6

C -.2e-6 -.2e-6 .2e-6 .2e-6
x</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="figure"><img src="fiberleak.png" width=275 height=171 alt="Geometry of a leaky waveguide."></div>
      <p>The '<tt>l</tt>' lines specify a linear (straight) dielectric interface. The syntax is '<tt>l nleft nright
	&rho;1 z1 &rho;2 z2</tt>', meaning a straight line from (&rho;,z)=(<tt>&rho;1,z1</tt>) to (<tt>&rho;2,z2</tt>)
	with refractive indices <tt>nleft</tt> and <tt>nright</tt> on the left-hand and right-hand sides of this line,
	respectively (as seen when walking from point 1 to point 2).</p>

      <p>The '<tt>b</tt>' lines specify a three-point B&eacute;zier curve. The syntax is '<tt>b nleft nright &rho;1 z1
	&rho;2 z2 &rho;3 z3</tt>'. (Internally, two more nodes are interpolated between points 1+2 and 2+3 to make sure
	the local curvature is zero at the ends of the curve).</p>

      <p>Now let's run wgms3d:</p>

      <div class="codebox">
	$ wgms3d -g fiberleak.mgp -l 1.55e-6 -U -0.8e-6:500:+2.3e-6 -V -1.0e-6:181:+1.01e-6 -n 4 -s 1.98 -P e:30:0.5
      </div>

      <p>The new command-line arguments have the following meaning:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><tt>-s 1.98</tt> tells wgms3d to search for modes with an effective index in the neighbourhood of 1.98. This
	  argument is important, since otherwise wgms3d doesn't know which mode you're interested in; it would rather
	  output some 'spurious' modes whose fields are concentrated inside the PML region, which have no physical
	  significance but whose effective index is larger than 1.98 and thus would be preferably returned by the
	  eigenvalue solver.</li>
	<li><tt>-P e:30:0.5</tt> enables a PML absorbing layer at the '<tt>e</tt>'ast side of the computational domain,
	  with a thickness of 30 discretization points, and whose strength is scaled by a factor of 0.5 relative to the
	  default 'optimum' PML strength given in the paper. Appropriate settings for this option depend on the
	  waveguide geometry and on the considered mode and must be found by trial-and-error, using the plot commands to
	  inspect the calculated modes and check them for obvious errors due to undesired reflections at the PML.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The computation now takes a bit longer and consumes more memory due to the larger number of discretization
	points. The shell output looks something like this:</p>

      </div>

      <p>The output now also gives you the leakage losses in dB per unit of length (here, since the waveguide geometry
	as well as the wavelength was specified in meters, the leakage losses are in dB/m). Furthermore, the two
	previously degenerate fundamental modes of the fiber here split up into clearly distinguishable (predominantly)
	horizontally and vertically polarized modes, with effective indices of 1.992 and 1.976, respectively.</p>

      <p>To visualize the modes, go back to Matlab and enter:</p>
      <div class="codebox">
	>> wgms3d_plot_ht(0, 'Geometry', 'fiberleak.mgp', 'LogContours', 3, 'RealContours')
      </div>

      <div class="figure"><img src="leakht01.png" width=359 height=278 alt="Plot of leaky mode with absolute-value contours."></div>
      <p>Here, the <tt>RealContours</tt> option results in the contour plot to be based on the real part of the mode
	field only, so that you can directly see the radiated field in the slab in the form of a spatial
	oscillation. The radiated field is slightly non-uniform since several modes are excited in the slab due to the
	asymmetry in its upper left corner. The beginning of the PML region on the right-hand (east) side of the
	computational domain is marked with the thick black dashed line.</p>

      <p class="clearfloats">
	If you omit the <tt>RealContours</tt> option, the contours will display the <em>absolute value</em> of the
	field:</p>

      <div class="codebox">

      </div>

      <div class="figure"><img src="leakht02.png" width=359 height=278 alt="Plot of leaky mode with real-part contours only."></div>
      <p>The absolute value of the field corresponds to the radiation <em>amplitude</em> and does not significantly
	oscillate. In this display mode you can clearly see how the PML damps the field without introducing a standing
	wave in the slab due to parasitic reflections. This indicates that our PML settings are probably okay (neither
	too weak nor too strong). (Try out what happens when you change the PML scaling from 0.5 towards much lower or
	much higher values.)</p>

	<h3 class="clearfloats">7. Calculating complex modes</h3>

      <p>It is well-known that some waveguide structures, even when they consist only of lossless dielectrics and
	perfectly conducting metals, may have modes with a complex (i.e., neither purely real nor purely imaginary)
	propagation constant. This can happen even if the waveguide is straight and does not have any obvious means for
	energy to leak away from the waveguide core.</p>

      <p>wgms3d can also be used to calculate these 'complex modes'. A PML is not necessary. Just run the mode solver
	with the respective geometry; if complex modes are there, they will be returned just like any other mode.</p>

      <p>Here, as an example, we consider the waveguide from Fig. 4b in <span style="font-style: italic;"> J. Strube,
	F. Arndt, "Rigorous Hybrid-Mode Analysis of the Transition from Rectangular Waveguide to Shielded Dielectric
	Image Guide," IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, vol. MTT-33, no. 5, May 1985:</span></p>

      <p>Modes #0, #1 and #2 are ordinary propagating modes of the waveguide, since their effective index is real. Modes
	#3 and #4 are the complex modes whose computation we wanted to illustrate here. They always come in
	complex-conjugate pairs. Mode #5 is an ordinary evanescent mode of the waveguide, since its effective index is
	purely imaginary. Here we plot one of the complex modes:</p>

      <h3 class="clearfloats">8. Remarks</h3>

      <p>Some more things that deserve mention:</p>

      <ul class="spacedout">
	<li>The <b>discretization grids</b> in the examples above were not optimized in any way. In practice, you should
	  improve the discretization grid (as well as play with the PML settings) until the result you're interested in
	  (effective index, leakage losses, overlap integrals computed from the mode fields, etc.) does not change
	  significantly any more. It can happen that you need a lot of computer memory to obtain the accuracy you
	  desire. Don't just use some arbitrary grid and use the first result that comes along. It can help to use
	  inhomogeneous grids where more samples are taken in regions where the mode field is expected to vary
	  strongly. See the
	  <tt>tests/silicon_strip_waveguide/</tt> subdirectory.

	<li>The <tt>tests/</tt> subdirectory in the wgms3d distribution contains some <b>test programs</b> that
	  reproduce known exact results from waveguide theory or other numerical results from the literature.</li>
	
	<li><b>wgms3d can be called from within Matlab</b> and the resulting data imported into easily handled Matlab
	  structures, so that parameter studies can be automated. I haven't documented this yet, but you can see how it
	  is done by having a look at the scripts in the <tt>tests/</tt> subdirectory of the wgms3d distribution.</li>

	<li>The Matlab function <tt>wgms3d_tracemodes</tt> can be used to perform parameter-continuation studies, where
	  you need to <b>trace the evolution of a specific mode as geometrical parameters are changed.</b> For example,
	  that script also handles automatic step-size control in this context. To learn how to use this script, see the
	  examples in the <tt>tests/disk_resonator/</tt> and <tt>tests/tm2te_leakage/</tt> subdirectories.</li>

	<li>The <b>unit of length</b> used in the geometry file, in the definition of the computational domain and in
	  the simulation wavelength can be freely chosen by the user. It just has to be consistent. For example, in this
	  tutorial, <tt>fiber.mgp</tt> was defined in microns, and the remaining geometries were defined in meters. The
	  performance of wgms3d should be independent of the chosen unit of length.</li>

	<li>This documentation is incomplete; it doesn't cover the full functionality of wgms3d right now. Try out
	  the <tt>-h</tt> command-line option to see more options, such as semi-vectorial and scalar computation
	  modes.</li>

	<li>If you have any questions on using this program, don't hesitate
	  to <a href="mailto:m.krause@tu-harburg.de">contact the author</a>.</li>

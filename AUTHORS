wgms3d was written by Michael Krause <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>.

Thanks to Henry Wu <henrywuuts@gmail.com> for doing initial
experiments on parallelizing wgms3d (pwgms3d-1.3), which inspired the
modularization of the old code base (wgms3d-1.2.2) and the
introduction of the solver_slepc.cc module.

Furthermore, wgms3d incorporates some code by:

* Steven G. Johnson <stevenj@alum.mit.edu>
    (autoconf macros for LAPACK and BLAS detection;
     original license: GPL with autoconf exception)

* The lib2geom team,
  Marco Cecchetti <mrcekets at gmail.com>,
  Michael G. Sloan <mgsloan@gmail.com> and others
    (geometry.h, bezier.cc:
     some geometry and BÃ©zier code;
     original license: LGPL-2.1 or MPL-1.1)

* Per Vognsen <vognsen@frost.slimy.com>
    (bezier.cc:
     polynomial root finder;
     original license: "This software is free for any use.")
